# New-To-OldRedditInterface
Brave extension that automatically changes www.reddit.com webs to new.reddit.com, which ironically switches to the old UI.

Apparently new.reddit.com doesn't seem to work on my Google Chrome since new.reddit.com redirects me back to www.reddit.com, so at this moment this extension only works on Brave. Will change if someone tells me it works on their end.
