# New-To-OldRedditInterface
Brave extension that automatically changes www.reddit.com webs to new.reddit.com, which ironically switches to the old UI.

This extension doesn't seem to work on my Google Chrome since new.reddit.com redirects me back to www.reddit.com, so at this moment this extension only works on Brave. Will change if someone tells me it works on their end.


Just to clarify, this doesn't change to the way old interface, since that UI is accesible from old.reddit.com, just from the new wobbly UI to the one that has been used before 2024.
