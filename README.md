# New-To-OldRedditInterface
Brave extension that automatically changes www.reddit.com webs to new.reddit.com, which ironically switches to the old UI.

This extension only works when logged in, since new.reddit.com redirects back to www.reddit.com if you don't have an account.


Just to clarify, this doesn't change to the way old interface, since that UI is accesible from old.reddit.com, just from the new wobbly UI to the one that has been used before 2023.
